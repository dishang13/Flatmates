    ==================================================
    |   Use of Class Variables as Global Constants   |
    ==================================================
    All of the variables in this class are Class Variables (typed with the "static" keyword")
    with Constant values, which can be accessed in any class in the project by specifying
    Constants.CONSTANTNAME, i.e., ClassName.ClassVariableName

    |   Our Design Decision for Use of External Files   |
    =====================================================
    We decided to use directories external to our application for the storage and retrieval of user's files.
    We do not want to store/retrieve external files into/from our database for the following reasons:

        (a) Database storage and retrieval of large files as BLOB (Binary Large OBject) degrades performance.
        (b) BLOBs increase the database complexity.
        (c) The operating system handles the external files instead of the database management system.

    WildFly provides an internal web server, named Undertow, to display external files.
    See https://docs.wildfly.org/21/Admin_Guide.html#Undertow

    ========================================================================================
    |   For storing and internally accessing external files, we use absolute file paths.   |

     STEP 1: Comment out the constant under "To run locally" above.
     STEP 2: Uncomment the constant under "To run on your AWS EC2 instance" above.

     STEP 3: Comment out the constant under "To run locally" below.
     STEP 4: Uncomment the constant under "To run on your AWS EC2 instance with your IP address" below.
     STEP 5: Replace 54.92.194.218 with the public IP address of your AWS EC2 instance.

     STEP 6: Select Build --> Rebuild Project.
     STEP 7: Run your app to generate the WAR file. Do not use the app locally!
     STEP 8: Use the generated WAR file to deploy your app to your AWS EC2 server.

     STEP 9: Undo the above changes to run the app locally.
